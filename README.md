# ICE X AGENT PROTOTYPE

## Project info

**URL**: https://howcanibehelpful.xyz

## What is this?

This is a prototype app, designed to begin testing end game agentic use cases of open, user-owned data.

This app is not an official app of Icebreaker and is currently just an experiment by web3pm (+ some AIs) on using data that I have reclaimed through Icebreaker and zkTLS. 

However, as part of our build in the open philosophy, this experiment is open source, as is the eventual tooling and infrastructure that powers Icebreaker. Use at your own risk.

This tool is designed to allow you to bring your own API key and network data and start interacting with your network data in whatever way you find useful. 

To use, you need 2 things:
- An OpenAI secret key
- A network export of your icebreaker network, ideally after completing your zkTLS network import

You can download your network as a signed json file by visiting https://app.icebreaker.xyz/network/export?includePrivateChannels=true&limit=1000 while signed in.
